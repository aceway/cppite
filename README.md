### cppite:  c++ Interactive Test Environment.
* Version 0.0.1

### What is this repository for? ###

* This software was inspired by slime/ipython.
* I always need to write, compile & run some tempory c++ code, because I'm not sure it is right or wrong. Most of the fragments will be used in a project with many source files. So if I write these code in the project, it will cost a very long time to compile. Then I always make some cpp files with a main function and put these code in it, make a Makefile or a gcc/g++ command line to compile those files. At last, run it & check it. If the result is OK, copy those code to my project environment, or give up those files and code. Next time do the same step.
* One day I realized I need an environment like slime or ipython to write & test those tempory code fragments.
